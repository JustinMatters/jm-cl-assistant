## Phase 18 — Tools

### Implementation Strategy

There are two approaches to giving the assistant access to tools:

**Approach A — Router-dispatched (current plan):**
The Ollama router classifies the query into a tool-specific tier (e.g. `maths`,
`weather`, `datetime`) and the orchestrator calls the tool directly without
involving an LLM. This is fast, cheap, and deterministic — but it requires the
small classification model to correctly identify every tool-worthy query, and
each new tool needs a new routing tier in the system prompt.

**Approach B — LLM tool use (function calling):**
The OpenAI-compatible API (and Claude natively) supports a `tools` parameter
where you define function schemas. The model decides when to call a tool,
generates structured arguments, and the client executes the function and feeds
the result back. This is more flexible — the model can chain tools, use tools
mid-conversation, and handle ambiguous queries — but it only works for the
Claude tiers (Sonnet/Opus via OpenRouter), not the local Ollama models which
have limited or no tool-use support.

**Recommended hybrid approach:**
- Use **Approach A** (router-dispatched) for tools that map to obvious,
  unambiguous queries: calculator, datetime, weather. These are fast and
  don't need LLM judgement.
- Use **Approach B** (LLM tool use) for tools that benefit from model
  judgement: web search (deciding what to search for), location-aware
  follow-ups, or chaining multiple tools. Register tool schemas with the
  OpenRouterClient and handle the tool-call response loop.
- Start with Approach A for all tools (simpler), then migrate selected tools
  to Approach B once the basic infrastructure works.

### Tool definitions vs Claude Code skills — keeping them separate

This project is built using Claude Code, which has its own skill/hook system
(defined in `.claude/` and invoked via slash commands during development).
The tools defined in this phase are **runtime tools for the assistant app** —
they live in `src/tools/` and are called by `Orchestrator.respond()` at
runtime. The two systems are completely separate:

| Concern | Claude Code skills | Assistant runtime tools |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Where defined | `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md` | `src/tools/*.py` |
| When invoked | During development (by the dev) | At runtime (by the app) |
| Who calls them | Claude Code CLI | `Orchestrator.respond()` |
| Configuration | `settings.json`, slash commands | Router tiers or LLM `tools` param |

To keep the boundary clear:
- All runtime tool code lives under `src/tools/` (never in `.claude/`)
- Tool schemas for LLM function calling (Approach B) are defined in a
  `src/tools/registry.py` module, not in any Claude Code config file
- The word "skill" is reserved for Claude Code; the app calls its own
  capabilities "tools"
- Tests for runtime tools live in `tests/test_*.py` alongside existing tests

### Current tool inventory

The router currently routes arithmetic and maths calculations to `simple_ollama`
(the 8B model) because LLMs can produce incorrect results for numerical
computation. Phase 18 replaces that with dedicated tools so deterministic
tasks are solved reliably and cheaply without involving a large model.

### T18.1 — Calculator Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `calculate(expression: str) -> str` tool in `src/tools/calculator.py`
  that evaluates arithmetic expressions safely (no `eval` on arbitrary code)
- Use the `simple_eval` or `asteval` library, or implement a safe AST-based
  evaluator, to support basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`,
  parentheses, and common maths functions (`sqrt`, `abs`, `round`, etc.)
- Return the result as a formatted string, or a clear error message if the
  expression is invalid
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_calculator.py`

### T18.2 — Integrate Calculator into Orchestrator
**Status:** not started

- Add a `maths` classification tier to the router system prompt so arithmetic
  and calculation queries are routed to `maths` instead of `simple_ollama`
- In `Orchestrator.respond()`, intercept the `maths` classification and call
  the calculator tool instead of an LLM
- Update `_backend_labels` to include a `"maths"` entry (e.g. `"Tool: calculator"`)
- Update tests in `test_orchestrator.py` and `test_router.py`

### T18.3 — Unit Conversion Tool (stretch)
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `convert(value, from_unit, to_unit) -> str` tool in
  `src/tools/converter.py` using the `pint` library
- Cover common categories: length, mass, temperature, volume, speed, time
- Integrate into orchestrator similarly to the calculator
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_converter.py`

### T18.4 — Web Search Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `web_search(query: str) -> str` tool in `src/tools/web_search.py`
- Use the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API (no API key required) or the
  `duckduckgo-search` library as the backend
- Return a concise summary of the top results (title + snippet + URL)
  formatted as plain text suitable for passing back to an LLM or reading aloud
- Add a `web_search` classification tier to the router system prompt for
  queries that require current information (news, recent events, live data)
- Integrate into `Orchestrator.respond()` with `_backend_label` `"Tool: web search"`
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_web_search.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.5 — Location Tool (IP Lookup)
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `get_location() -> dict` tool in `src/tools/location.py`
  that resolves the user's approximate location from their public IP address
- Use a free IP geolocation API (e.g. `ip-api.com` — no key required) returning
  city, region, country, latitude, and longitude
- Cache the result for the session to avoid repeated lookups
- Expose a `get_location_str() -> str` helper that returns a human-readable
  location string (e.g. `"London, England, GB"`) for use by other tools
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_location.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.6 — Date and Time Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `get_datetime(timezone: str | None = None) -> str` tool in
  `src/tools/datetime_tool.py`
- Return the current date and time formatted as a readable string
  (e.g. `"Sunday 29 March 2026, 14:35 BST"`)
- If no timezone is supplied, attempt to infer it from the location tool
  (T18.5); fall back to UTC with a note
- Use the `zoneinfo` stdlib module (Python 3.9+) — no extra dependency needed
- Add a `datetime` classification tier to the router system prompt for
  queries about the current time or date
- Integrate into `Orchestrator.respond()` with `_backend_label` `"Tool: datetime"`
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_datetime_tool.py`

### T18.7 — Weather Forecast Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement a `get_weather(location: str, days: int = 7) -> str` tool in
  `src/tools/weather.py`
- Use the Open-Meteo API (free, no API key required) with geocoding via the
  Open-Meteo geocoding endpoint to resolve location names to coordinates
- Return a day-by-day forecast summary for up to 7 days: date, condition,
  high/low temperature (°C), precipitation probability
- If `location` is `"auto"`, call the location tool (T18.5) to resolve the
  user's current location automatically
- Format output as plain text suitable for reading aloud via TTS
- Add a `weather` classification tier to the router system prompt
- Integrate into `Orchestrator.respond()` with `_backend_label` `"Tool: weather"`
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_weather.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.8 — Tool Registry and LLM Function Calling Infrastructure
**Status:** not started

- Create `src/tools/registry.py` containing a `ToolRegistry` class that:
  - Stores tool definitions as OpenAI-compatible function schemas (name,
    description, parameters JSON schema)
  - Maps tool names to callable Python functions
  - Provides a `schemas()` method returning the list for the API `tools` param
  - Provides an `execute(name, arguments) -> str` method to dispatch a call
- Update `OpenRouterClient.ask()` to optionally accept a `tools` list and
  handle the tool-call response loop: send tools → receive tool_use stop
  reason → execute tool → send tool result → receive final response
- This is the foundation for Approach B tools (LLM-chosen tool use)
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_registry.py`

### T18.9 — Currency Conversion Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement `convert_currency(amount, from_code, to_code) -> str` in
  `src/tools/currency.py`
- Use the free frankfurter.app API (no key required, ECB exchange rates,
  updated daily) or exchangerate.host as a fallback
- Return a formatted string (e.g. "100.00 USD = 91.47 EUR (rate: 0.9147)")
- Cache exchange rates for the session to avoid repeated lookups
- Good candidate for Approach A (router-dispatched) — queries like "convert
  50 euros to dollars" are unambiguous
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_currency.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.10 — Dictionary / Definition Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement `define(word: str) -> str` in `src/tools/dictionary.py`
- Use the Free Dictionary API (dictionaryapi.dev, no key required)
- Return: word, phonetic, part of speech, top 2-3 definitions, and an
  example sentence if available
- Format as plain text suitable for TTS
- Good candidate for Approach A — "define serendipity" or "what does
  ephemeral mean" are clear triggers
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_dictionary.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.11 — Wikipedia Summary Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement `wiki_summary(topic: str) -> str` in `src/tools/wikipedia.py`
- Use the Wikipedia REST API (`en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/`)
  — no key required, returns a plain-text extract
- Return the first 2-3 sentences of the article summary, plus the URL
- Good candidate for Approach B (LLM tool use) — the model can decide when
  a factual query would benefit from Wikipedia vs its own knowledge, and
  can rephrase the search term for better results
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_wikipedia.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.12 — URL Content Summariser
**Status:** not started

- Implement `summarise_url(url: str) -> str` in `src/tools/url_reader.py`
- Fetch the page content, extract readable text (use `trafilatura` or
  `beautifulsoup4` + `requests`), and truncate to a reasonable length
- Pass the extracted text to the current Claude tier with a "summarise this
  page" system prompt, returning the summary
- Best suited for Approach B — the model detects a URL in the user's message
  and decides to fetch and summarise it
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_url_reader.py` (mock HTTP calls)

### T18.13 — Reminder / Timer Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement a session-scoped reminder system in `src/tools/reminders.py`
- `set_reminder(message: str, minutes: int) -> str` — schedules a callback
  that pushes a notification into the Gradio chat after the delay
- `list_reminders() -> str` — shows active reminders
- Requires Gradio's `gr.Timer` or background thread to inject messages
  into the chat after a delay — investigate feasibility
- Good candidate for Approach B — the model parses natural language like
  "remind me in 10 minutes to check the oven"
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_reminders.py`

### T18.14 — System Info Tool
**Status:** not started

- Implement `system_info() -> str` in `src/tools/sysinfo.py`
- Return a summary of the host machine: OS, CPU, RAM total/available,
  GPU name and VRAM (via `torch.cuda` if available), Python version,
  loaded Ollama models
- Uses only stdlib (`platform`, `os`, `shutil`) plus optional `torch`
- Useful for debugging and for the assistant to understand its own
  environment (e.g. "how much VRAM do I have free?")
- Router-dispatched (Approach A) — queries like "system info" or "how
  much memory do I have" are unambiguous
- Add unit tests in `tests/test_sysinfo.py`
